. What Facilitates the Connection?

Key Facilitators:
	1.	HTTP Protocol:
	•	Communication happens over HTTP(S), with the frontend making requests to the backend’s API endpoints.
	2.	JSON:
	•	JSON is the standard format for data exchange between the frontend and backend.
	3.	API Requests (Frontend):
	•	fetch, axios, or similar libraries in the client make HTTP requests.
	4.	REST Endpoints (Backend):
	•	Controllers or request handlers in the backend expose endpoints for the client to interact with.
	5.	CORS:
	•	Configurations in the backend ensure that requests from the client are allowed.
	6.	Environment Variables:
	•	.env files on both the client and server ensure smooth communication by defining base URLs, API keys, or other configurations.
